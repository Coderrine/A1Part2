Object is a public class that has a type and hashcode. Its type is defaulted to object unless a type is given, so the type is converted to the given. Its hashcode is created using make_hash that calls reinterpret_cast on this. Objects equal function compares its hash to the objects given one, returning the result. It also contains getters for type and hash. 

Queue is a subset of Object and has 5 variables that are capacity, front, back, size, and data. Data represents the array of objects that is the queue. Queue_empty checks if size is 0 while queue_full checks if the capacity has been reached. FrontElement returns the element at the 0 index of the queue/ the next element to be removed. Queue_push adds an element at the back of the array assuming capacity has not been reached, then increments the value by 1. Queue_pop checks if the queue is empty than removes the element at the front and returns a new data array with all elements shifted to the left. It also has a getter for size.
